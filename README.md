## General Information
I built this game primarily as a way of familiarizing myself with Java and to get a hands-on perspective on what goes
into the development of a game. Pong is a simple enough game with a plethora of tutorials available on how to create it
in a variety of different languages, which made it a promising choice for a first project.


## Setup
In order to run this game, simply download the source files into a text editor, build, and then run the Main function.

## Project Status
This project is complete. I have gotten out of this what I sought, which was an introduction to game development and 
object-oriented design in Java.


## Room for Improvement

If one wishes to build more on this project, the following are a few simple ideas for improvements:
- Title Screen: Having a Title Screen from which the player can start a game would make the beginning of the game
  less sudden, allowing the user to enter and exit a match without having to close and reopen the window.
- Win Condition: Currently, the game will run perpetually if not closed. Adding a winning score would give each game
a conclusion without having to close the window.
